# Trace Ball

## Brief Description
It's 1 on 1 in this simple yet intense battle! The aim of the game is to lead your opponent on a wild goose chase. You will be able to change difficulty for more intense action.

## The enemy
* Our enemy is relentless and will chase you down no matter what. There's no reasoning with it!
* As the time increases, so does the speed of the opponent.
* The game is a win if time runs out and you're still alive.
* Don't let him catch you, three strikes and you're out!
